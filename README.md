# ajaxform

> ðŸš¨ This extension will become unsupported once Contao 4.13 LTS is EOL. This is because [we have contributed the
> feature to Contao Core](https://github.com/contao/contao/pull/5307). You can use it as of Contao version 5.1 and you will thus no longer need this extension ðŸŽ‰

Allows you to submit your forms that were generated with the built-in form generator via Ajax.
After the installation you will have a new content element called "Form with Ajax" available.
Simply choose that and enjoy the magic.

It also works with redirects so you can use it in combination with e.g. ["mp_forms"](https://github.com/terminal42/contao-mp_forms).

This extension does not require jQuery or MooTools and thus only works in modern browsers.
